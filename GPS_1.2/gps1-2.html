      <div class="content-section" id="pp-Description">
        <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is a programming technique where two programmers work on the same piece of code together.  Generally, this is done by one programmer, the navigator, leading the other programmer, the driver, while the driver enters in the code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section" id="pp-Why">
        <h2>Why is pair programming important?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Pair programming is used often in professional programming projects.</li>
            <li>More accurate code due to error checking.</li>
            <li>Collaboration produces more efficient code and functionality.</li>
            <li>Pair programming is often used in the job interviewing process.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section" id="comparison">
        <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
        <p>The driver is the person typing the code, while the navigator provides guidance on the direction of the code.  The driver should only be focused on code that the navigator instructs them to work on.</p>
