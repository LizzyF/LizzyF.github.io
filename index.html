      <h2>Kitchen vs. The Table</h2>
      <h3>02/06/2015</h3>
      <p>Just finished watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, and I feel very inspired.  After watching all the videos about feedback and emotional intelligence and engineering empathy, I feel so uplifted and am so excited to begin Phase 1.  What made DBC stand out for me was its focus on engineering empathy.  I had never encountered this term before in any of my research into software engineering.  DBC's philosophy and credo support what I have come to realize over the years.  In searching for a job, in trying to find a career, I thought there was too much focus on things like efficiency, profit, "success", but not enough on "soft skills" such as compassion, empathy, and kindness.  I saw that one's humanity was a skill that one needed to foster and develop, because it is just as important, if not more so, as any other skill.  I think that when companies lose sight of their customers, of the community they serve, and become preoccupied with money and power, that's when these companies fail.</p>
      <p>Back to DBC: that's why I was so excited to apply to the program, because it focused on the people.  No matter how important technology becomes, everything boils down to human interaction and making connections.  Code to learn.  Watching Shereef's chat just reinforced my reasons for applying to DBC.  If anything, I'm worried that my expectations may be too high.  I am nervous, and I know it will be a lot of work, but I don't think it will fully hit me until I get on site.  But I'm going into this hopeful and optimistic, knowing that each day is a new opportunity to grow and improve upon the last.  By going through this program, I'm hoping to become the person I know I can be, and to develop lifelong friendships with like-minded people who want to help others and to create a supportive community.  I can't wait!</p>

      <h2>Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h2>
      <h3>02/05/2015</h3>
      <p>Version control is a system that keeps track of changes made to a file.  If one makes a mistake, one can revert back to an earlier version of the file.  This system is efficient and simple, and allows people to be creative and try out new things without having to worry about losing their work.</p>
      <p>Git helps keep track of changes by using commits, which are like snapshots, or an official save, of a file as it progresses.  An example would be a team working together on a project.  There is a master branch, or draft, of the project.  Collaborators can each make a copy of this branch, thereby creating their own individual branches.  Each person can make changes to that branch without having to worry about accidentally overwriting someone else's work.  When they are ready, they can merge the individual branches back to the master branch to create a final team project.  If something goes wrong, the team can revert back to a previous version of the project.</p>
      <p>Git lives locally on one's computer, while GitHub lives online.  One can store one's files online so that others can see and give feedback on what one is doing.  This allows one to engage in a dialogue with others, and exchange ideas.  One's work may spark an idea for someone else, or someone's feedback may change the course of one's project.</p>
