      For me, the problem of conflicts arise because I don't speak up when something first bothers me.  I may get annoyed by something a roommate does, or like the example given in the challenge, I try to take the high road and lead by example.  But often, with things like dirty dishes in the sink, those problems don't resolve themselves because the people doing those things may not even know that their actions are bothering someone else, because that someone else doesn't say anything.

      What happens is I bottle up my feelings, and I don't express my anger when something bothers me.  I think that I'm being too sensitive, and that whatever is bothering me isn't a big deal, and I should just let it go.  But the problem is that when that thing happens again, and again, each time the frustration builds.  I finally realized that it was okay to express my feelings.  I felt like I wasn't being respected by other people, but what the real problem was was that I wasn't respecting myself.  The phrase, "You teach others how to treat you" comes to mind, and throughout my life, I was teaching others not to respect me because I didn't respect myself.  I would put other's needs before my own, and I would downgrade my needs, and then I would get mad when someone treated me this way.  I think that deep down I knew this problem had been of my own making, but only recently has it really hit me that I needed to respect myself first before others could respect me.
