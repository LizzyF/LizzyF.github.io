      Just finished watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, and I feel very inspired.  After watching all the video's about feedback and emotional intelligence and engineering empathy, I feel so uplifted and am so excited to begin Phase 1.  What made DBC stand out for me was it's focus on engineering empathy.  I had never encountered this term before in any of my research into software engineering.  DBC's philosophy and credo support what I have come to realize over the years.  In searching for a job, in trying to find a career, I thought there was too much focus on things like efficiency, profit, "success", but not enough on "soft skills" such as compassion, empathy, and kindness.  I saw that one's humanity was a skill that one needed to foster and develop, because it is just as important, if not more so, as any other skill.  I think that when companies lose sight of their customers, of the community they serve, and become preoccupied with money and power, that's when these companies fail.

        Back to DBC: that's why I was so excited to apply to the program, because it focused on the people.  No matter how important technology becomes, everything boils down to human interaction and making connections.  Code to learn.  Watching Shereef's chat just reinforced my reasons for applying to DBC.  If anything, I'm worried that my expectations may be too high.  I am nervous, and I know it will be a lot of work, but I don't think it will fully hit me until I get on site.  But I'm going into this hopeful and optimistic, knowing that each day is a new opportunity to grow and improve upon the last.  By going through this program, I'm hoping to become the person I know I can be, and to develop lifelong friendships with like-minded people who want to help each other and to create a supportive community.  I can't wait!
