      When I think about my values, it sort of gives me a positive boost and renews my enthusiasm and excitement for whatever goal I am pursuing.  The problem is reminding myself of these values, as I sometimes get bogged down in the details and pettiness of daily life.  I can see why people have inspirational sayings taped around their bedrooms or offices, because they need constant reminders of what drives them and keeps them going.  I'm reminded of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, and how there was a lot of repetition in the book, but that's because he needed to constantly remind himself of things he was learning to reinforce the teachings.  This is what I need to do, to pull myself out of the low points that I sometimes find myself in.

      I think that reminding myself of my values can help mediate stereotype threat, because stereotype threat is what other people think, and is an external force, and in no way affects or changes who I really am.  If someone thinks something about me that isn't true, it's not my job to change that because it doesn't matter.  I know who I am, and nothing anybody else does will change it.  The only person who changes me is me.  To let the stereotype threat affect me would be to allow someone else to change me, and then essentially that other person wins.  I know it isn't a competition, but to have someone else think that I am weak or ignorant because of some superficial thing, and then me to give in to that, would be to allow that person to think they are right, when they aren't.
