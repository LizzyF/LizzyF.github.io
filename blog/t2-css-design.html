    <h3>Relative</h3>
    <p>
      Setting an element to relative positioning will not affect the element until changes are made to its positioning attributes: top, bottom, left, right.  Once a change is made to a position attribute, such as <code>left: 20px;</code>, the element will move 20 pixels to the right from where it would have normally been.  A relatively positioned element is still part of the page flow.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Absolute</h3>  
    <p>
      With absolute positioning, when the positioning attributes are set, the element will be positioned in relation to the first parent element that doesn't have static positioning.  If there is none, then the element is positioned relative to <html> (the page itself).  An abolutely positioned element is not part of the page flow, meaning it doesn't affect other elements and isn't affected by other elements. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Fixed</h3>
    <p>
      A fixed position element will stay where it is in the browser when the window is scrolled up or down.  This element is out of the page flow.
