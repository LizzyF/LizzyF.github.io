      From what I understand, Ruby classes are very similar to JavaScript constructor functions.  In Ruby, one creates instances of classes, objects, using the initialize method.  One can then assign attributes to the object using instance variables.  This object has inherited the methods and attributes of its parent class.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      In JavaScript, a new object can be formed using the contructor function.  While this newly formed object does not have the same inheritance feature as found in Ruby, properties can be assigned to the object using variables and the <code>.method</code> feature.
