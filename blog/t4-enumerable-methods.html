      An enumerable method applies to collections of data, such as arrays and hashes.  The enumerable method goes through each element in the collection, making whatever changes to each that is specified in the code block.  An example would be: 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <code>
        names = ["leonard", "bernadette", "amy"]
        names.map {|i| i.capitalize}
      </code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the example, there is an array called <code>names</code>.  What the <code>map</code> method does is go through each element in the array, capitalizing the first letter of each name, outputting the information to a new array.  With the map method, the new array given will have the same number of elements as the beginning array.
