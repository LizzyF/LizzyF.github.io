      This issue is a complicated one.  As happens, I started out with an opinion on what should be done, but upon further research, I realized there are more nuances I had not foreseen.  One thing that hasn't altered, though, is the fact that change has come, and will continue to come, and those who try to resist it will only make it harder for themselves.  I know because I was one of those people.  I didn't want to see that the tech industry is here to stay, and will only continue to grow and evolve, and affect other industries around it.  To have this "not in my backyard" mentality is narrow-minded and will only aggravate the problem.  By trying to control the situation and hold tight to what is "mine" will not prevent people from coming to the Bay Area, and it won't preserve San Francisco's culture, because what makes any city great is how dynamic it is in response to change and growth.

      There seems to be a debate that pits the "true" San Franciscans against the tech industry and the "outsiders" who have not grown up in the city.  I grew up in the East Bay, so technically I may be considered the latter.  What I see in this debate is the tyranny of the majority.  There are so many voices shouting, but there is no true dialogue, no conversation that is being had.  I understand that people want to preserve the city's culture, to keep the things that make this city great and what attracted people and companies here in the first place.  However, this past year I saw the protests get violent, where buses were vandalized, and employees from tech firms were actually followed home.  This is going too far, and it is just scapegoating those people while ignoring the real causes behind the problems.  The income inequality, the homelessness, the housing shortage, all these problems are a result of decades of mismanagement and faulty policies, and it will probably take another decade to solve them.  I'm getting lost in the maze that is the complicated relationship between the tech industry and San Francisco.

      I see the tech industry as a beneficial thing.  It has boosted the city's economy and provided jobs and created other industries, and I feel on the whole, it has brought prosperity to the city.  What people don't seem to like is that they aren't getting their share of the pie.  The tech industry does seem to be making other industries obsolete, or definitely drawing revenue away from them.  But I see this more as a governmental issue, where the state and federal government need to help schools redesign their curriculums to reflect the world's changing needs.  We need to get to the root of the problem, which I feel is education and families.  We need to change the way students are taught math and science, and show them how vital they are in this new knowledge economy, and on creating supportive home environments so that students can focus on their studies and not on the stresses of their home life.  But these issues are tough, and there is no quick fix, which is why I think politicians and policymakers focus more on the band-aid solutions, platforms upon which they can campaign on and show constituents the tangible results they have gained.

      But this isn't to say the tech industry doesn't share part of the blame as well.  I feel that there is a certain obliviousness to the outside world.  People are so focused on changing it that they don't actually see it for what it is, and the very real problems it has.  There is a sort of bubble around the people who work in tech companies, I feel.  But that doesn't mean those people don't care.  I think they want to help, they just don't know how, or haven't had their eyes opened to the problems that are right in front of them.  I don't begrudge those who have worked hard from enjoying the fruits of their labors, but to a point.

      I was hoping this blog post would be more articulate and nuanced, but it's a complicated issue.
