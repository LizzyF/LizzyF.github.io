      While researching web security, I came across an article on DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) threats: <a href="http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/web-security-outlook-2015-mega-vulnerabilities-expected-fuel-ddos-attacks">Web Security Outlook for 2015</a>.  An attack attempts to make a network or website unavailable to its intended users.  One way this is done is by flooding the target with communications requests, overloading the system and rendering the target inactive.  These attacks increasingly use "botnets" or "zombie" computers that are taken over through vulnerabilities in the computer's system.

      I think it's discouraging how people use a great resource such as the internet to hurt others.  With the recent hackings of Sony, Home Depot, and Target, I see the greater importance of building secure software.  It is also important to educate people on the importance of web security and privacy, and providng them with the tools and techniques they can use to do that.  People are also worried about their privacy, what with the recent revelations about the NSA and its surveillance of the American people.  However, I feel that with security comes certain tradeoffs.
