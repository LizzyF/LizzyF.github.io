      This time around I have been pairing more, which has been a great experience.  Although I am not on the same skill level as everyone else, I make sure I've prepped before hand, which usually involves having already completed the challenge, so that I feel somewhat comfortable and ready to contribute something.  My most recent pairing session was really helpful, as I was able to see how the other person tested the code as he wrote it, and learned some new Sublime shortcuts.  It was a wonderful learning experience, inspiring and encouraging in that it made me believe that maybe, just maybe, I could do this.

      I still worry though that I will have nothing to bring to the table.  I can read code, but only slowly, and I'm still working on piecing the coding puzzle together.  Does it ever truly come together though?  With the pace technology is moving at, I feel that just as I'm starting to fit pieces together, someone comes along and swipes half of the puzzle and throws in a bunch of new pieces.  But back to pairing: I learn more from working with others, and in a shorter amount of time, than working and struggling through the material on my own, which makes sense, as two heads are better than one.  But a destructive pattern of mine is that when I encounter roadblocks or something tough, I try to struggle on my own, and when that doesn't work, I retreat.  I need to work on overcoming these failures, these bumps in the road, and developing more grit because if I want to achieve even half of what I hope to do, I'm going to need a thicker skin to survive.

      The feedback I've been given has been helpful, and supports what I already know I need to change.  People say I should speak up more and ask questions, because it seems like I am holding back.  This is true, as it sometimes takes me a bit to figure out what I want to say, and I also want to make sure that I have all the information before forming an opinion.  But what I'm learning, more and more, is that there will never be enough time or information, and that I will need to make the best choices based off of what is currently available.  I need to be able to move quickly and nimbly as situations change, because one thing I have learned, is that life never goes according to plan, and change always comes, whether I'm ready for it or not.
