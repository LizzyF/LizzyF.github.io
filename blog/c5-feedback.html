      Everyone I've paired with so far has been great.  People are patient and kind, and really easy to work with.  The last few pairing sessions have been difficult, not because of the other person, but because of me.  I have been getting behind in the challenges, and so when I'm pairing, I feel that I have nothing to bring to the table.  I don't want to be the person who drags everyone down, and that has been what's happening the past couple of challenges.  As a result, I want to pair less, when I actually should be pairing more because I learn more from working with others, and in a shorter amount of time, than working and struggling through the material on my own.  This has been a pattern of mine, which is frustrating because with Dev Bootcamp I wanted to start fresh.  When I encounter roadblocks or something tough, I try to struggle on my own, and when that doesn't work, I retreat.  I have been going to tutoring sessions, but in the end, my learning is up to me.

      The feedback I was given was helpful, and supported what I already knew that I needed to change.  A lot of the feedback was that I was behind technically, which I knew, but it was still hard to read.  Also, people said I should speak up more and ask questions, because it seemed like I was holding back.  This is true, because I have so many questions, but I don't want to bog down the pairing session with them and waste time.  I think this is just a sign that I need to practice more.  The feedback was helpful, and I think that I just need to learn the material better so that the next time I pair, I will have something to offer.  Writing feedback was difficult in the beginning, because I needed to write something actionable.  I don't like to give criticism, even though I know it can be helpful, because I feel that I'm not in the place to be giving criticism, since there is so much I need to improve upon.

      All in all, I think pairing and feedback are great aspects of the program.  I think the pairing aspect might benefit more if new students could pair with tutors, as some of the tutors seem to be alumni and can provide helpful feedback and advice about the program as a whole.
