      An array is an ordered list, and each slot in the array is given an index number, starting at 0 instead of 1.  If one wanted to call an item from the array, one would first list the arrays name, and then the index number of the slot being called, in brackets.  Example: array[0].
    </p>
      A hash is like an array, but instead of using an index number to call a certain item from a list, key value pairs are used.  An example of when a hash would be used over an array would be state names and their abbreviations.  The state name would be the key, such as "California", and its value would be "CA".  Only this key can retrieve its corresponding value.
