      An array is an ordered list, and each slot in the array is given an index number, starting at 0 instead of 1.  If one wanted to call an item from the array, one would first list the array's name, and then the index number of the slot being called, in brackets.  Example: <code> array[0]</code>.  Items can also be retrieved using a negative index number, starting from the end of the array.  To create an array, one can use the literal constructor, which are just brackets: <code>[ ]</code>, or the new method: <code>Array.new</code>.

        <p>Array Indexing:</p>
        <code>
        <p>array =             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
        <p>index # =            0  1  2  3  4</p>  
        <p>negative index # =  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1</p>
        </code>
      </p>
    </p>

      A hash is similar to an array, but instead of using an index number to call a certain item from a list, key-value pairs are used.  For a great description of a hash, see <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-3.html" target="blank"><i>Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</i></a>.  An example of when a hash would be used instead of an array would be state names and their abbreviations.  The state name would be the key, such as "California", and its value would be "CA".  Only this key can retrieve its corresponding value.  Hashes can be created using the new method: <code>Hash.new</code>
