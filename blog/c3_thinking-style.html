      My thinking style is abstract random, which means that I organize information through reflection.  I do well in unstructured, people-oriented environments.

      In my research on the abstract random thinker, I found that such a person likes to listen to others and bring harmony to group situations, establishing relationships with others, and focusing on the issues at hand.  She has heightened instincts and intuition, and cares deeply for the welfare of others.  This person learns best in a personalized environment, with constant feedback and collaboration, and personal attention and emotional support.  This type of thinker prefers an environment that is free from conflict and competition, where her efforts are recognized and appreciated  The topic at hand must be shown to be relevant to people, and to answer the question, "Why is this important?"  Otherwise, the AR thinker will disengage because the information does not seem relevant or applicable to the real world.  The abstract random thinker has trouble with: authoritarian people, restrictive environments, and criticism.  There is a danger of over-helping, where the AR thinker neglects her own work in helping someone else with theirs.  Sources of stress are: people who jump to negative conclusions, time limits, inflexible schedules, giving exact answers, finishing one thing at a time, and demands to prove intuitions.

      I was surprised by how spot on the descriptions of the abstract random thinker were.  I started recognizing the problems I've had in the past because they went against my learning style, and also how wrong I had been in thinking I learned best one way, when I actually learned better the complete opposite way.  But I think this is a reflection of my life in general, and how I would ignore my instincts because I felt that I was wrong and someone else was right.  I was essentially ignoring and denying who I was, thinking that someone else knew what was better for me than me.  I can now see why I chose Dev Bootcamp as well.  The non-competitive, more personalized, and unstructured environment will hopefully allow me to thrive because now I am more in tune with what I need.

    <p>I also have to remind myself that there is no one better way of learning or thinking than another.  In one of the articles about growth and fixed mindsets, it mentioned that one mindset is not better than the other, and that one needs different mindsets for different things.  Now that I know I am an abstract random thinker, I also know that I need to work on setting time limits, and on completing things one at a time, because in the working world, there are deadlines and projects that need to be completed in a timely and orderly fashion.  To do this, I need to continue working on timeboxing myself, and on finishing tasks before moving onto the next one.
