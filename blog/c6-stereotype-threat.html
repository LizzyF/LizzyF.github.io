      It's only been recently that I've noticed stereotype threat, and how it may have affected me personally.  I generally worry a lot already, so I don't know how much more stereotype threat adds to this anxiety.  I definitely do understand the pressure one feels when one perceives that one's performance is being judged.

      If I think stereotype threat is occurring, I will try to remind myself not to take it personally, and that someone else's weakness should not affect how I behave, and does not change who I am.  I find that when I feel insecure, I tend to retreat and hide.  I need to force myself to confront these fears and own up to what I don't understand, and make sure that I ask questions and ask for help if I need it.

      If I see that someone else may be feeling stereotype threat, I will try to remind that person of his or her strengths, and try to help that person focus on the bigger picture, where one action, or one test, is not indicative of who that person is as a whole.  To create a supportive and welcoming environment, I will try to foster communication.  To do this, I first must set the example and speak up and engage when I feel there is a problem, or if I don't understand something.  If I expect others to be open, I must be as well, and not hide or retreat when I feel scared.

      To create meaningful feedback, I need to be honest and respectful of other people and of their opinions.  This means that if I have to give critical feedback, instead of trying to water it down or be politically correct, I need to treat the other person as an adult and see them as capable of handling negative feedback, but also making sure to give it in a kind manner.  I will try to treat others as I want to be treated, and I want others to be honest with me, even if the feedback is difficult to hear, because it is this type of feedback that will help me grow the most.  The toughest things to hear are potentially the most important things I need to know.
