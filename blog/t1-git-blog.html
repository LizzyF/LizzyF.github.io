      Version control is a system that keeps track of changes made to a file.  If one makes a mistake, one can revert back to an earlier version of the file.  This system is efficient and simple, and allows people to be creative and try out new things without having to worry about losing their work.

      Git helps keep track of changes by using commits, which are like snapshots, or an official save, of a file as it progresses.  An example would be a team working together on a project.  There is a master branch, or draft, of the project.  Collaborators can each make a copy of this branch, thereby creating their own individual branches.  Each person can make changes to that branch without having to worry about accidentally overwriting someone else's work.  When they are ready, they can merge the individual branches back to the master branch to create a final team project.  If something goes wrong, the team can revert back to a previous version of the project.

      Git lives locally on one's computer, while GitHub lives online.  One can store one's files online so that others can see and give feedback on what one is doing.  This allows one to engage in a dialogue with others, and exchange ideas.  One's work may spark an idea for someone else, or someone's feedback may change the course of one's project.
